📝 Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, starting from data loading in Python to building a dashboard in Power BI and generating insights through a final report and presentation.
It showcases skills in EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, SQL analysis, dashboard development, and business reporting.

🔍 Project Steps


1️⃣ Load Data in Python
Imported dataset using Pandas
Checked data structure, missing values, and datatypes
Performed initial exploration

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution analysis of key fields
Identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies
Visualization using Matplotlib/Seaborn
Summary statistics & correlations

3️⃣ Data Cleaning
Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Fixing inconsistent formats
Treating outliers
Converting data types

4️⃣ Feature Engineering
Creating new calculated columns
Encoding categorical features
Feature transformation & normalization (if required)
Preparing data for deeper analysis

5️⃣ SQL Analysis (MySQL)
Executed SQL queries for:
Filtering and aggregations
Joins for combining tables
Customer/product / sales analysis
Insights extraction using GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries

6️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
Designed an interactive dashboard that includes:
KPIs and summary cards
Trend charts (line/area)
Categorical distribution (bar/pie charts)
Filters/Slicers
Detailed drill-down view

7️⃣ Report Creation
Explained methodology
Highlighted insights and trends
Visual representation of key findings
Business recommendations

8️⃣ Presentation (Gamma AI)
Designed a clean & professional slide deck
Included dashboard screenshots
Summarized findings for non-technical stakeholders


📈 Key Results & Insights
Summary of major findings (customize):

Example: Customer churn is highest in month-to-month contracts (42%)

Example: Sales increased by 18% after promotional campaigns

Example: Top 10% customers contribute 45% of revenue
